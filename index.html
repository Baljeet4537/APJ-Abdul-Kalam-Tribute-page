          <p>
            <b>A. P. J. Abdul kalam</b> Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul
            Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical
            Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology. Dr. Kalam made
            significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's
            first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
            successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit
            in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space Club. He
            was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle
            programme, particularly the PSLV configuration. After working for
            two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies, Dr.
            Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided
            Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the
            Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme
            (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and
            operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building
            indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking of
            multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence
            Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence Research & Development
            from July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he led to the
            weaponisation of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II
            nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy,
            which made India a nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to
            self-reliance in defence systems by progressing multiple development
            tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.

          <h1>Early life and education</h1>
          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, to a Tamil Muslim family. His
            father,Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and mosque imam,
            while his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam was the youngest
            of five siblings. The family, originally wealthy Marakayar traders
            and landowners, faced financial decline with the failure of their
            businesses, leading to poverty by the time Kalam was born. As a
            young boy, he contributed to the family's income by selling
            newspapers. Despite average grades in school, Kalam was a dedicated
            and hardworking student, particularly excelling in Mathematics.
            After completing his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
            Ramanathapuram, he graduated in Physics from St. Joseph's College,
            Tiruchirappalli, in 1954. In 1955, Kalam moved to Madras Institute
            of Technology to study aerospace engineering. During a senior class
            project, he faced a challenging deadline set by the Dean but managed
            to impress by meeting it, securing his scholarship. Although Kalam's
            dream of becoming a fighter pilot was narrowly missed due to his
            placement in the qualifiers, he continued to pursue a successful
            career in aerospace engineering.
          </p>

          <h1>Career as a scientist</h1>
          <p>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
            Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist.
            He became a member of the Defence Research & Development Service
            (DRDS). Initially working on designing a small hovercraft at DRDO,
            Kalam later joined INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the
            renowned space scientist. He was subsequently recruited into ISRO by
            H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket
            Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
            Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he served as the
            project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
            (SLV-III), successfully deploying the Rohini satellite in near-earth
            orbit in July 1980. Kalam had initiated work on an expandable rocket
            project independently at DRDO in 1965. In the same year, he received
            government approval and expanded the programme to include more
            engineers. Between 1963 and 1964, Kalam visited NASA's Langley
            Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in
            Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Throughout the
            1970s and 1990s, he played a key role in developing the Polar
            Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which
            were successful. Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness
            India's first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, as the representative of
            TBRL. Despite not participating in its development, he played a role
            in directing projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, aiming
            to develop ballistic missiles from the successful SLV programme.
            Kalam also played a significant role in initiating the Integrated
            Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), working on missiles
            like Agni and Prithvi, despite criticism for mismanagement and cost
            overruns. From July 1992 to December 1999, Kalam served as the Chief
            Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation. During this period,
            he played a crucial role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, serving as
            the Chief Project Coordinator alongside Rajagopala Chidambaram. In
            1998, he collaborated with cardiologist Soma Raju to develop a
            low-cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent." In 2012, they
            designed a rugged tablet computer for healthcare in rural areas,
            known as the "Kalam-Raju Tablet.
          </p>

          <h1>Presidency</h1>
          <p>
            Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R.
            Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral
            vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal.
            His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. On 10 June 2002,
            the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) expressed that they would
            nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi
            Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. Kalam
            filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament on 18 June. The
            polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, and
            Kalam became the 11th President of the Republic of India in an easy
            victory. He moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after being sworn in
            on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been
            honored with a Bharat Ratna before becoming the President, and he
            was the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati
            Bhawan. During his term as president, he was affectionately known as
            the People's President. Kalam was criticized for his inaction in
            deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to
            him. Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President
            to grant pardons, suspend, or commute the death sentence of convicts
            on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea during his tenure,
            rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee. He also took the
            controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.
            In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh,
            Kalam supported the need for a Uniform Civil Code in India. At the
            end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to
            consider a second term in office but later decided not to contest
            the 2007 presidential election. Nearing the expiry of the term of
            the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in
            April claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second
            term. On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest the 2012
            presidential poll, stating his decision not to do so.
          </p>

          <h1>Post-presidency</h1>
          <p>
            After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the
            Indian Institute of Management Shillong, the Indian Institute of
            Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management Indore;
            an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore;
            chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology
            Thiruvananthapuram; professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna
            University; and an adjunct at many other academic and research
            institutions across India. He taught information technology at the
            International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, and
            technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University. In 2011,
            Kalam was criticized for his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power
            Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and
            was accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters
            were hostile to his visit, seeing him as a pro-nuclear scientist and
            unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety
            features of the plant. In May 2012, Kalam launched a program for the
            youth of India called the What Can I Give Movement, with a central
            theme of defeating corruption.
          </p>
          <h1>Death</h1>
          <p>
            On 27 July 2015, Kalam traveled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on
            "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of
            Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
            experienced some discomfort but was able to enter the auditorium
            after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into
            his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany
            Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or
            any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care
            unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45
            p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were
            reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?" Following his death,
            Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from
            Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the
            morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight
            landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the
            President, the vice-president, the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of
            Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian
            Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then
            placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to
            his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and
            numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister
            Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president
            Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. On
            the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag,
            was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force
            C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His
            body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and
            national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar
            Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan, and the governors of
            Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a
            brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to
            the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to
            his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body
            was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to
            allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that
            evening. On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at
            Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honors. Over 350,000
            people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the
            governor of Tamil Nadu, and the chief ministers of Karnataka,
            Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh.
          </p>
          <h1>Awards and honours</h1>
          <p>
            Kalam received 7 honorary doctorates from 40 universities.[152][153]
            The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981
            and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and
            his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.[154] In 1997,
            Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna,
            for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of
            defence technology in India.[155] In 2008 Kalam was the recipient of
            Hoover Medal.[156] And in 2013, he was the recipient of the Von
            Braun Award from the National Space Society "to recognize excellence
            in the management and leadership of a space-related project".[157]
            In 2012, Kalam was ranked number 2 in Outlook India's poll of the
            Greatest Indian.[158] Following his death, Kalam received numerous
            tributes. The Tamil Nadu state government announced that his
            birthday, 15 October, would be observed across the state as "Youth
            Renaissance Day;" the state government further instituted the "Dr.
            A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Award", constituting an 8-gram gold medal, a
            certificate and ₹500,000 (US$6,300). The award will be awarded
            annually on Independence Day, beginning in 2015, to residents of the
            state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the
            humanities or the welfare of students.[159] On the anniversary of
            Kalam's birth in 2015 the CBSE set topics on his name in the CBSE
            expression series.[160] Prime Minister Narendra Modi ceremonially
            released postage stamps commemorating Kalam at DRDO Bhawan in New
            Delhi on 15 October 2015, the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.
            Researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) had
            discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the International Space
            Station (ISS) and named it Solibacillus kalamii to honour the late
            president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.[161] Several educational and
            scientific institutions and other locations were renamed or named in
            honour of Kalam following his death.
